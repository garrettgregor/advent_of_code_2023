# Day 1

Today, I did my first LeetCode challenge in a long time, and took a while to get through an "easy" problem but managed to solve it in about 12mins. Then, I attempted another "easy" problem and eventually found myself so confused that I turned to the solutions to look for answers. I was happy to find that a lot of other people found the problem to be tricky and poorly worded, and even forwarded it to a previous cohortmate who thought the same. I'm looking forward to getting in the habit of trying these advent challenges and using this as a springboard to get back in the habit of coding daily. Thanks Erin!
